Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending 
electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric 
characters, between two or more users of mobile devices, desktops/lapt
ops, or another type of compatible computer. Text messages may be sent 
over a cellular network or may also be sent via satellite or Internet 
connection.

The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message 
Service (SMS). It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multim
edia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) containing di
gital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as 
emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and instant messenger appl
ications (usually the term is used when on mobile devices).
